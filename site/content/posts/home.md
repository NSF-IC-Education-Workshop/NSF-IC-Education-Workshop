# [![NSF](nsf.png)](http://nsf.gov) Workshop Overview

US academic integrated circuit (IC) design education and research are
facing challenges in many dimensions including access to process
models and fabrication, cost of fabrication, the complexity of
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) flows, declining enrollments, and the loss
of instructional project support from MOSIS.  At the same time,
foreign competitors, especially China, are investing heavily in IC
fabrication, design, and education, leading to increased competition
and national security risks. We are hosting two workshops to gather
needs from academics, and insights from industry hiring managers as
well as IC fabrication and EDA tool companies to develop a vision for
the future.  
# Virtual Workshop 

We held a [virtual workshop on October 14-15, 2021](oct_meeting) for initial information gathering.

# In-Person Workshop 

We held an [in-person (invitation only) workshop May 20-21, 2022](may_meeting) to create a
detailed plan and outcome report.

# Final report

We have released [a final report with our recommendations.](report)
