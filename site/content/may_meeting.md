# Format

For the in-person workshop, there was a mixture of presenters, panels, group
discussion, and breakout groups. After introductions, we had a presentation
from IMEC which was identified as a potential model to replicate in our virtual
workshop. After this, we had a lively panel on the importance of open-source
and proprietary EDA tool flows with representatives from both academia and
industry.

The remainder of the workshop was a rotation of pre-assigned representatives on
five topic areas identified during the virtual workshop. It was ensured that
each breakout group had representation from the steering committee, industry
(EDA, design and manufacturers) and academia. The five topic areas were:
* Technology Nodes
* Packaging and Testing
* IP
* EDA Tool Flows
* Training and Education

These topic areas correspond to the sections in the final report. The breakout
groups were charged with identifying the state-of-the art, the main challenges,
and a set of feasible recommendations. Each attendee was able to participate on
three of the breakout areas during the first day. After each breakout session,
we had a group discussion of the results so that all attendees could
participate and help reflect.

At the end of the first day, we assigned chairs of each topic area. The second
day was spent combining the breakout discussion results into the final report.
Attendees were allowed to attend any topic and were encouraged to switch
throughout the day to particpate on more than one.
