For the virtual workshop, a range speakers were selected from a
diverse set of stakeholders in government, academia and
industry. These speakers were considered for their diverse opinions and unique experiences.
They were asked to consider which [questions](/questions) are most
concerning to them and what solutions might exist.

Each position statement has 20 minutes total (strictly enforced for
the equity of presenters. In your position statement, you should spend
the first 5-10 minutes (no questions allowed) discussing your primary
concerns and potential solutions. We will then follow up with 5-10
minutes of Q&A for discussion. For example, if you speak for 10
minutes there will be a limit of 5 minutes of Q&A. If additional time
is needed, we will mark it as an item for discussion in the Q&A after
the group of speakers.
